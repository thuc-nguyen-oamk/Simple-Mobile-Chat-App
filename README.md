# Introduction
This is a simple 1-1 Chat App made with Kotlin and Firebase where you can chat with your friend.
It also has the 'virtual friend' feature where you can chat with a bot.
Updated 2022 November: the bot provider has disabled free access, so the 'virtual friend' has no longer worked.

## How to use
1. Download the file **app-debug.apk** in the repository's base directory
2. Install it into your android device or an emulator
3. Run the application.
